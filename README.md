## About
This is an android app aimed at transferring colors to a black and white image or removing colors from a colorful image.
So, try out the app and you will find that adding new life to your memorable photos is just a button click away...!

## Project Information
The main aim of the app is to add appropriate colors to a black and white image or to pop colors from an image which would bring new life to them.
Color transfer between two images is one of the most hyped tasks in image processing. Fortunately, image processing and the use of deep learning has made it possible upto a satisfactory level.
Since different colors may have the same luminance or intensity, most of the tasks are only done by manual work. Many black-white photos are rendered with user interaction by PhotoShop which is one of most popular colorization softwares.
But this app will use Machine Learning to automatically colourize the image.

## Platform
We are going to create an Android app. With the help of OpenCV and Tensorflow libraries in Android, we will implement the required image processing to make these features (“color pop” and “colorize”) possible in the phone.
